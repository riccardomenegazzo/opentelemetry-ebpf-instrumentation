# Node.js runtime metrics

With `application_runtime` enabled, OBI collects event-loop, garbage-collection,
heap and active-resource metrics from instrumented Node.js services and exports
the following metric set.

The values are the runtime's own `perf_hooks` and `v8` readings, reported by a
small JavaScript agent that OBI injects through the Node.js inspector — the
exported numbers match what the application itself would measure.

## Metrics

| OTel metric | Prometheus metric | Runtime source | Export behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `nodejs.eventloop.time` | `nodejs_eventloop_time_seconds_total` | `performance.eventLoopUtilization()` | Counter of cumulative loop time, attribute `nodejs.eventloop.state` = `idle` \| `active`. |
| `nodejs.eventloop.utilization` | `nodejs_eventloop_utilization_ratio` | `performance.eventLoopUtilization()` | Gauge in [0, 1]: active share of the last sampling interval, derived from the deltas of the cumulative idle/active times. |
| `nodejs.eventloop.delay.min` | `nodejs_eventloop_delay_min_seconds` | `monitorEventLoopDelay()` | Gauge; histogram minimum over the last sampling interval. |
| `nodejs.eventloop.delay.max` | `nodejs_eventloop_delay_max_seconds` | `monitorEventLoopDelay()` | Gauge; histogram maximum over the last sampling interval. |
| `nodejs.eventloop.delay.mean` | `nodejs_eventloop_delay_mean_seconds` | `monitorEventLoopDelay()` | Gauge; histogram mean over the last sampling interval. |
| `nodejs.eventloop.delay.stddev` | `nodejs_eventloop_delay_stddev_seconds` | `monitorEventLoopDelay()` | Gauge; histogram standard deviation over the last sampling interval. |
| `nodejs.eventloop.delay.p50` | `nodejs_eventloop_delay_p50_seconds` | `monitorEventLoopDelay()` | Gauge; 50th percentile over the last sampling interval. |
| `nodejs.eventloop.delay.p90` | `nodejs_eventloop_delay_p90_seconds` | `monitorEventLoopDelay()` | Gauge; 90th percentile over the last sampling interval. |
| `nodejs.eventloop.delay.p99` | `nodejs_eventloop_delay_p99_seconds` | `monitorEventLoopDelay()` | Gauge; 99th percentile over the last sampling interval. |
| `v8js.gc.duration` | `v8js_gc_duration_seconds` | `PerformanceObserver` `'gc'` entries | Histogram of per-cycle GC durations, attribute `v8js.gc.type` = `major` \| `minor` \| `incremental` \| `weakcb`; one observation per collection. |
| `v8js.memory.heap.limit` | `v8js_memory_heap_limit_bytes` | `v8.getHeapSpaceStatistics()` `space_size` | UpDownCounter (Prometheus gauge), attribute `v8js.heap.space.name`. |
| `v8js.memory.heap.used` | `v8js_memory_heap_used_bytes` | `v8.getHeapSpaceStatistics()` `space_used_size` | UpDownCounter (Prometheus gauge), attribute `v8js.heap.space.name`. |
| `v8js.memory.heap.space.available_size` | `v8js_memory_heap_space_available_size_bytes` | `v8.getHeapSpaceStatistics()` `space_available_size` | UpDownCounter (Prometheus gauge), attribute `v8js.heap.space.name`. |
| `v8js.memory.heap.space.physical_size` | `v8js_memory_heap_space_physical_size_bytes` | `v8.getHeapSpaceStatistics()` `physical_space_size` | UpDownCounter (Prometheus gauge), attribute `v8js.heap.space.name`. |
| `v8js.resource.active` | `v8js_resource_active` | `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()` | Gauge of live resources keeping the event loop alive, attribute `v8js.resource.type`; a type that vanishes between samples is reported once with 0 so the series drops instead of going stale. |

Enable Node.js runtime metrics through the shared runtime metrics feature:

```yaml
metrics:
  features:
    - application_runtime
```

The agent samples at a fixed 1 s interval, independently of the exporter
interval; there is no sampling-interval configuration because the interval is
compiled into the injected script. GC durations are the exception: they are
observed per collection cycle, not sampled. The GC histogram boundaries
default to the semconv advisory values and can be overridden through the
exporter `buckets.v8js_gc_duration_histogram` option.

The `application_runtime` feature alone enables the injection — traces are not
required. The metrics are produced by the injected agent running inside the
application, so enabling the feature starts injecting the agent into every
Node.js process OBI discovers, and each injection is logged with
`trigger=runtime metrics`. `nodejs.enabled` (default `true`) is the global
opt-out: setting it to `false` disables the injection entirely — runtime
metrics included — and OBI logs a warning when `application_runtime` is
enabled at the same time.

## Collection path

The injected agent reports in-process readings over an eBPF side channel:

1. During discovery, the Node.js injector opens the inspector (sending
   `SIGUSR1` if it is not already listening) and evaluates the OBI agent
   (`fdextractor.js`) through a single `Runtime.evaluate` message.
2. Every second the agent reads `performance.eventLoopUtilization()`
   (cumulative idle/active nanoseconds) and the `monitorEventLoopDelay()`
   histogram (reset after each read, so delay values are per-interval), and
   encodes the ten values as fixed-width hex into a synthetic path:
   `fs.existsSync("/dev/null/obi-rt/<10 × 16 hex chars>")`. On the same tick
   it walks `v8.getHeapSpaceStatistics()` and emits one
   `/dev/null/obi-v8/h...` record per heap space (four fixed-width values,
   the engine-defined space name last), and folds
   `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()` into per-type counts, emitting one
   `/dev/null/obi-v8/a...` record per type (count first, the type name
   last); a type present on the previous tick but absent now is emitted
   once with count 0. GC cycles are pushed as they are observed: a
   `PerformanceObserver` emits one `/dev/null/obi-v8/g...` record per
   collection (kind and duration).
3. The generic tracer's `uv_fs_access` uprobe decodes the payloads
   (rejecting any malformed record — exact-length, hex and name-length
   validation), stamps kernel time and the calling thread's namespaced pid,
   and submits `k_event_type_nodejs_eventloop`, `k_event_type_nodejs_gc`,
   `k_event_type_nodejs_heap_space` and `k_event_type_nodejs_resource`
   events through the shared BPF event ring buffer.
4. Userspace converts raw events into `RuntimeMetricSnapshot` values and
   forwards them through the runtime metrics queue.
5. OTEL and Prometheus exporters consume queued snapshots, apply per-service
   `application_runtime` feature gating, compute counter deltas and the
   utilization ratio, and emit the metrics.

## Requirements and limitations

The Node.js support has three version thresholds, each gating a different
feature. They are not the same number and are easy to confuse:

| From | What it unlocks | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `12.17`, excluding `13.0`-`13.9` | Any injection at all: trace-context propagation, and the delivery path every runtime metric uses | The agent constructs an `AsyncLocalStorage` |
| `14.0` | `nodejs.manual_spans`, when enabled | `spanbridge.js` uses nullish coalescing |
| `14.10` | `nodejs.eventloop.time`, `nodejs.eventloop.utilization`, `v8js.gc.duration`, `v8js.memory.heap.*` | `performance.eventLoopUtilization()` |
| `16.14` | `nodejs.eventloop.delay.*`, `v8js.resource.active` | `Histogram.count`, `process.getActiveResourcesInfo()` |

- **Injection floor: 12.17+, with `13.0`-`13.9` excluded.** The agent constructs
  an `AsyncLocalStorage`, which Node.js added in 13.10.0 and backported to
  12.17.0 — so the 13.x releases below 13.10 predate it and clear the 12.17
  bound at the same time. Below the floor the agent throws
  `TypeError: AsyncLocalStorage is not a constructor` on evaluation and nothing
  is instrumented.

  The injector reads the version from the executable's `.rodata`, which carries
  the inspector's own `node.js/<version>` literal
  (`src/inspector_socket_server.cc`) in every build and survives stripping. A
  runtime whose version cannot be read is declined as well — deliberately, since
  the version is the only evidence that the agent can run there. A build that
  hides it therefore loses Node.js instrumentation, and the skipped process is
  named in a warning so that is visible rather than silent. The check runs
  before SIGUSR1, so an unsupported process is never signaled, its debugger
  port is never opened, and there is nothing to close afterwards — which also
  keeps OBI away from Node.js 9.x and earlier, where closing the inspector
  segfaults the process (see below).

- **`nodejs.manual_spans` needs 14.0+.** `spanbridge.js` uses nullish
  coalescing, which Node.js enabled by default in 14.0.0, and the injector
  concatenates it with the extractor into a single `Runtime.evaluate`. On an
  older runtime the whole payload fails to parse, taking propagation and the
  runtime metrics with it, so the injection is refused outright rather than
  delivering less than was asked for. Leaving manual spans off keeps the 12.17
  floor.
- Node.js 14.10+ (`eventLoopUtilization` API) for the event-loop time and
  utilization metrics; the delay gauges (`Histogram.count`) and the
  active-resource gauge (`getActiveResourcesInfo`) additionally need
  Node.js 16.14+. On 14.10-16.13 those metrics are absent while ELU metrics
  keep working.
- The GC kind is read from `PerformanceNodeEntry.detail` (Node.js 16+), with a
  fallback to the pre-16 `entry.kind` accessor, so `v8js.gc.duration` works
  from the same 14.10 floor as the rest.
- Only the well-known `v8js.heap.space.name` values are exported
  (`new_space`, `old_space`, `code_space`, `map_space`,
  `large_object_space`). Semconv allows custom values, but the extra spaces
  V8 reports (`read_only_space`, `shared_space`, ...) are
  engine-version-dependent, so they are dropped before export
  (debug-logged) to keep the series set stable.
- The same policy applies to `v8js.resource.type`: only the well-known
  values are exported (`Immediate`, `TCPServerWrap`, `TCPWrap`, `Timeout`,
  `TTYWrap`); the many other types Node reports (`FSReqCallback`,
  `MessagePort`, ...) are dropped before export (debug-logged). Node
  reports TCP connections as `TCPSocketWrap`; they are exported under the
  semconv member that documents them, `TCPWrap`.
- The inspector must be reachable: injection is skipped when OBI will not send
  `SIGUSR1` (see below), and fails when the environment blocks the inspector
  (e.g. seccomp) — in both cases the metrics are silently absent (an error is
  logged).
- A process reaches the injector only if discovery typed it Node.js, which it
  does from the executable's own symbols (`node::NodeMainInstance`,
  `node::Environment`, `node::Start`) or a mapped `libnode.so`, never from the
  name of the binary. The N-API surface does not count towards this, because
  Bun re-exports it, and neither do libuv's symbols, which every runtime
  linking libuv carries. A Bun binary installed as `node` is therefore not
  typed Node.js and is never signaled or injected.
- That type is not private to the injector. It also selects the
  `telemetry.sdk.language` resource attribute, the `package.json` service-name
  resolution, and Node.js route harvesting. A build that names none of the
  symbols and maps no `libnode.so` loses all four, and because Node links
  `libstdc++`, it is typed C++ rather than generic, so the emitted
  `telemetry.sdk.language` is wrong rather than merely absent. Official builds
  for 18 through 24 on glibc and musl, `strip -s` builds, distribution packages,
  single-executable applications, `pkg` bundles and Electron all carry the
  symbols; a build linked without `-rdynamic` is the shape that would not.
- `SIGUSR1` is withheld unless the signal cannot terminate the process and the
  application has no handler of its own. Each refusal is logged once, with a
  `reason`:
  - `SigCgt`/`SigIgn` in `/proc/<pid>/status` show `SIGUSR1` neither caught nor
    ignored, so sending it would terminate the process. A runtime is briefly in
    this state after `exec`, so OBI waits for it to install its handler before
    giving up;
  - `/proc/<pid>/status` could not be read;
  - libuv's signal tree shows a handler the application registered;
  - the application's source files mention `SIGUSR1`. This last check runs only
    when the libuv tree is unreadable, and is still fail-open: a scan that
    cannot complete reads as handler-free.
- The version check is a refusal of the same kind, decided from the executable
  before any of the signal gates run, with two reasons of its own: the runtime
  is below the injection floor, or its version could not be read.
- **Node.js 9.x and earlier segfault when the inspector is closed.**
  `process._debugEnd()` runs `Agent::Stop()`, which destroys the `ChannelImpl`
  carrying CDP responses; the reply to that same `Runtime.evaluate` is then
  sent over the freed channel:

  ```
  #0 node::inspector::ChannelImpl::sendResponse
  #1 v8_inspector::V8InspectorSessionImpl::sendProtocolResponse
  #3 v8_inspector::protocol::DispatcherBase::Callback::sendIfActive
  #4 v8_inspector::protocol::Runtime::EvaluateCallbackImpl::sendSuccess
  #5 v8_inspector::V8RuntimeAgentImpl::evaluate
  ```

  Reproduced on 9.3.0, where it is deterministic; 10.24.1 does not fault. The
  releases between the two were not tested, so where upstream stopped doing this
  is unknown. The injection floor is above both, so OBI no longer reaches this
  path — but the close itself still waits for a reply the call has made
  undeliverable. On a runtime that survives it the read returns at once, when
  the runtime drops the session, leaving a discarded error and a session OBI
  never closes.
- **Main-thread event loop only**: `perf_hooks` are per-thread and the agent
  runs on the main isolate, so `worker_threads` loops are not measured (the
  same scope as the standard OTel Node.js SDK). See the design notes for
  options to extend coverage.
- Injection is single-shot per discovered process; a transient failure at
  process startup is not retried.
- Injection runs on one worker goroutine off the discovery loop, because it
  waits on the target: for the runtime's own signal handler, and for the
  inspector to answer. The queue holds 100 pending processes; beyond that a
  process is dropped with a warning and is not injected. A queued process is
  pinned to the incarnation discovery saw, by start time and a process handle,
  so the executable read and the signal cannot land on an unrelated program
  that inherited the same PID in the meantime. The rest still works from the
  number: the gates read `/proc/<pid>`, and the inspector conversation enters a
  network namespace by PID, so a recycled PID can be the process examined and,
  where an inspector is already listening and no signal is needed, the one
  injected. Shutdown cancels the wait for the signal handler, but not the
  inspector conversation past it, which runs on its own deadlines.
- Injections never overlap, across runtimes as well as within one. Attaching to
  a JVM switches OBI's own euid and egid process-wide, which would otherwise
  cost a concurrent Node.js injection its access to `/proc/<pid>/mem` and its
  network namespace, so the Java and Node.js workers take turns through one
  shared slot. Pinning the process, which discovery does before queuing it, is
  outside that slot and still runs under whatever credentials an attach happens
  to hold, so it can fail for a process OBI would otherwise have injected.
- The inspector port (9229) is per network namespace, so among processes that
  share one — `cluster` workers, for instance — only the first to bind it is
  injected; the others log an attach error and report no metrics.
- An interval in which the event loop never yielded (fully blocked) reports
  zero delay samples; the exporters keep the previous window's delay values.
